## API Endpoints

This template provides several API endpoints for managing AI agents. Here are some examples:

### Create Agent

- **Endpoint**: `POST /agents`
- **Description**: Create a new AI agent.
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Agent Name",
    "type": "agent_type"
  }
  ```

### Get Agent

- **Endpoint**: `GET /agents/{agent_id}`
- **Description**: Retrieve details of a specific agent.

### List Agents

- **Endpoint**: `GET /agents`
- **Description**: List all agents.

### Update Agent

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /agents/{agent_id}`
- **Description**: Update an existing agent.

### Delete Agent

- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /agents/{agent_id}`
- **Description**: Remove an agent from the system.

## Testing

To ensure the quality of your application, you should write tests. The template includes a directory for both unit and integration tests. You can run the tests using:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
